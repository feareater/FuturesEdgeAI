## [v12.9] — 2026-04-04 — A5 Final Backtest with Breadth Scoring

### dollarRegime verification (Step 2)
- **No inversion bug found.** The `dollarRegime` mapping in `marketBreadth.js` was already correctly inverted at v12.8: `m6eRegime === 'bearish' → 'rising'`, `'bullish' → 'falling'`, `'neutral' → 'flat'`.
- Spot-check results for 2022:
  - 2022-01-03: M6E close 1.13870, m6eRegime=`bullish` → dollarRegime=`falling`. Correct: EUR/USD was near its local 21-day high on Jan 3 (dollar surge began late January).
  - 2022-06-15: M6E close 1.04860, m6eRegime=`neutral` → dollarRegime=`flat`. Reflects consolidation in the 21-day window.
  - 2022-09-28: M6E close 0.96510, m6eRegime=`neutral` → dollarRegime=`flat`. Near-trough consolidation; 20-bar position signal conflicts with SMA signal → neutral.
- The 21-day lookback classifier measures LOCAL regime, not annual trend. No code change needed.

### A5 Final Backtest — breadth+VIX+DXY active (job f3ae236b7509)

- off: 1,355 trades, WR 33.6%, net +$49,080

**BY BOND REGIME (Phase V):**
- bullish (bonds rallying = risk-off): 6,383 trades, WR 34.0%, net +$154,829
- neutral: 2,112 trades, WR 34.1%, net +$58,539
- bearish (yields rising = risk-on): 791 trades, WR 32.4%, net +$24,672

- 2 indices bullish: 823 trades, WR 34.0%, net +$15,890
- 3–4 indices bullish: 5,652 trades, WR 32.7%, net +$117,867

**COMPARISON TO v12.7 BASELINE (+$233,540):**
| Metric | v12.7 | v12.9 (breadth) | Delta |
|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Net P&L | +$233,540 | +$238,040 | +$4,500 (+1.9%) |
| Trades | 9,679 | 9,286 | -393 |
| WR | 37.3% | 33.9% | -3.4pp |
| PF | 1.689 | 1.584 | -0.105 |
| MaxDD | $3,208 | $2,908 | -$300 (9% lower) |

**Key findings:**
- Breadth scoring produced a **marginal net positive**: +$4,500 more P&L with 9% lower max drawdown.
- WR and PF declined because breadth scoring changed the trade mix (added lower-WR trades that passed the new threshold, removed some higher-WR ones that fell below it).
- **Strongest breadth edge**: `riskAppetite=neutral` → WR 37.2% (best across all breadth buckets).
- **Weakest**: `equityBreadth=2` (mixed signal bucket) → WR 34.0%, net only +$15.9K despite 823 trades.
- `equityBreadth=0–1` produces the highest WR (36.2%) — counter-intuitive but consistent with commodity/energy setups performing well in risk-off environments.
- VIX and DXY edges unchanged: edge holds across all regimes; DXY still provides no meaningful filter signal.

## [v12.8] — 2026-04-04 — Market breadth scoring from 16 CME instruments (Phase V)

### New file: `server/analysis/marketBreadth.js`
- **`classifyInstrumentRegime(closes)`** — classifies a single instrument from daily close array using two independent signals: 20-bar price position (close vs 20-bar high × 0.95 / low × 1.05) and 10-bar SMA direction (0.05% threshold). Both agree → that direction; one neutral → follow the other; disagree → neutral.
- **`computeMarketBreadth(getCandles, currentSymbol)`** — live mode; calls getCandles for all 16 symbols on '30m' TF, skips unavailable symbols gracefully.
- **`computeMarketBreadthHistorical(dailyClosesBySym, sortedDates, date)`** — historical mode; uses pre-loaded daily closes with strict no-lookahead (prior 21 trading days).
- **Breadth fields computed**: `equityBreadth` / `equityBreadthBearish` (0–4 count of MNQ/MES/M2K/MYM); `bondRegime` (ZN primary, ZB confirmation); `yieldCurve` (steepening/flattening/flat via ZT vs ZN); `copperRegime` (MHG); `dollarRegime` (falling/rising/flat via M6E inverse); `metalsBreadth` / `metalsBreadthBearish` (MGC/SIL/MHG); `fixedIncomeBreadth` (bearish bonds ZT/ZF/ZN/ZB/UB); `btcRegime` (MBT); `riskAppetiteScore` (−20 to +20); `riskAppetite` (on/off/neutral).
- **Risk appetite formula**: equity ×3 + bond ±2 + copper ±3 + dollar ±1 + bitcoin ±1; labels: on ≥5, off ≤−5, neutral.

### Updated: `server/analysis/marketContext.js`
- Imports `computeMarketBreadth` from marketBreadth.js
- `buildMarketContext()` calls `computeMarketBreadth(getCandles, symbol)` after HP/VIX/DXY context; adds `breadth` field to returned context object
- Wrapped in try/catch — breadth failure never breaks context build

### Updated: `server/analysis/setups.js`
- **`detectSetups()`**: stamps `setup.symbol = symbol` on all returned setups (required so `applyMarketContext` can classify the instrument category)
- **`applyMarketContext()`**: converted all `marketContext.hp.xxx` / `.options.xxx` / `.vix.xxx` / `.dxy.xxx` accesses to optional chaining so function works when context only has `breadth` and not HP data
- **Breadth additive scoring** (additive pts, not multipliers, cap ±15):
  - Equity setups: equity breadth ±5/6 pts, bond regime ±3/4 pts, copper regime ±4 pts, risk appetite ±3/5 pts
  - Commodity setups: copper regime ±4 pts, dollar regime ±3 pts, risk appetite ±3/5 pts
  - MGC/SIL/MHG: metals breadth ±4 pts
- `contextBreakdown` gains `breadth` (pts after cap) and `breadthDetail` (equityBreadth, bondRegime, copperRegime, riskAppetite)

### Updated: `server/backtest/engine.js`
- Imports `computeMarketBreadthHistorical` and `ALL_SYMBOLS` from instruments.js
- **`_loadDailyClosesForSymbol(sym)`**: reads last bar of each daily 1m file → `{ date: close }` map
- **`_precomputeBreadth(startDate, endDate)`**: loads daily closes for all 16 symbols once, computes `{ date → breadthObject }` for every trading date in range; logged with timing
- **`_minimalContext()`**: neutral context stub (multiplier=1.0, all bonuses=0) used when HP data unavailable but breadth exists
- **`runBacktestMTF()`**: calls `_precomputeBreadth` once before main loop; injects `breadth` into `mktCtx` on every bar; passes `symbol` in detectSetups opts
- **Trade record additions**: `equityBreadth`, `bondRegime`, `copperRegime`, `dollarRegime`, `riskAppetite`, `riskAppetiteScore`
- **`computeStats()`**: added `byRiskAppetite`, `byBondRegime`, `byCopperRegime`, `byEquityBreadth` breakdowns

### Updated: `public/backtest2.html` + `public/js/backtest2.js`
- **Market Breadth sub-tab** (Optimize tab): four breakdown tables — by riskAppetite (on/neutral/off), by bondRegime (bullish/bearish/neutral), by copperRegime, by equityBreadth bucket (0–1/2/3–4). Min 10 trades per row.
- **Inter-market sub-tab** (Optimize tab): equityBreadth (0/1/2/3/4) × riskAppetite (on/neutral/off) WR heatmap. Green ≥60%, amber 45–59%, red <45%, gray n<5.

### New file: `AI_ROADMAP.md`
- Documents the full AI/ML enhancement roadmap: Phase 1 (Claude batch analysis of trade records), Phase 2 (loss analysis), Phase 3 (decision tree `mlScoring.js`), Phase 4 (pattern discovery)
- Alert commentary re-enable plan (already built in `commentary.js`, currently dormant)
- Prerequisites checklist — Phase V breadth fields complete; B5 + 500 forward-test trades remaining
- Key principles: AI nudges (±15%), interpretability over accuracy, n≥30 minimum, loss analysis first
- Deferred decisions documented: local LLM, neural nets, AI signal generation

## [v12.7] — 2026-04-04 — DX/VIX pipeline + backtest engine enrichment (Phase U)

### Pipeline: DX extraction + parsing (Phase 1b loop 5 + Phase 1d DX block)
- **Phase 1b loop 5** (`historicalPipeline.js`): scans `Historical_data/DX/` for zip files; reads `metadata.json` to confirm `schema=ohlcv-1d`; extracts `.csv.zst` files to `data/historical/raw/DX/`; skip-if-exists per file. Result: 2,251 DX files extracted (IFUS.IMPACT, 2018-12-24 → 2026-04-03).
- **Phase 1d DX block** (`historicalPipeline.js`): reads `raw/DX/`, picks highest-volume non-spread DX contract per date (filters rows where `symbol` contains `-` and `close < 50`), auto-detects fixed-point vs decimal. Writes `data/historical/dxy.json`. Result: 2,251 dates, 0 errors, 0 out-of-range. Spot-checks: 2020-03-20=103.2, 2022-09-28=112.6 (USD peak), 2020-07-31=93.4. Range: 89.4–114.1.

### New file: `server/data/historicalVolatility.js`
- Exports `buildVolatilityIndex(futuresDir)`: reads MNQ 1m daily JSON files, extracts last-bar close, computes daily log returns, returns 20-day rolling realized volatility × `sqrt(252)` × 100 as `{ "YYYY-MM-DD": pct }`. Requires 21+ trading days before producing first value.

### Pipeline: Phase 1g (realized volatility VIX proxy)
- New `--phase 1g` in `historicalPipeline.js`: calls `buildVolatilityIndex()`, logs 5 spot-checks including March 2020 and late 2022, warns on values outside 5–100, writes `data/historical/vix.json`. Result: 1,767 dates (2019-06-03 → 2026-04-02). Crisis validation: March 2020 peak = **80.5%** ✓, Oct 2022 = **26.6%** ✓.

### Backtest engine enrichment (`server/backtest/engine.js`)
- Loads `data/historical/vix.json` and `data/historical/dxy.json` at job startup (gracefully optional — defaults to neutral if files absent)
- New helper `computeDxyDirection(dxyData, date)`: compares today's DXY close to 5-day rolling average; returns `rising` / `falling` / `flat` (flat if fewer than 3 prior dates)
- Added to every trade record: `vixRegime` (low/normal/elevated/crisis), `vixLevel` (numeric), `dxyDirection` (rising/falling/flat), `dxyClose` (numeric)
- Added to `computeStats`: `byVixRegime` and `byDxyDirection` breakdowns
- **zone_rejection disabled by default**: default `setupTypes` no longer includes `zone_rejection` — R:R structurally inverted at all confidence levels per A5 findings (AvgWin $16 vs AvgLoss $24 at conf≥80). UI still allows manual re-enable for research.
- **OR breakout 5m-only guard**: if `setup.type === 'or_breakout' && tf !== '5m'` → skip. A5 showed only 1/7,577 OR breakout trades came from 15m/30m.

### A5 Final validation: or_breakout + pdh_breakout, VIX+DXY active
- **9,679 trades** (5.4/day), WR 37.3%, PF **1.689**, Gross +$272,256, **Net +$233,540**, MaxDD $3,208
- vs or_breakout isolation (+$262K net): +$233K with pdh added — pdh still drags (-$14.6K net) but OR breakout slightly improved to $248K
- By VIX regime (net): crisis +$30K, elevated +$47K, low +$46K, **normal +$110K** — edge holds across all regimes, strongest in normal vol
- By DXY direction (net): falling +$97K, flat +$33K, rising +$103K — edge holds in both USD directions (no meaningful filter signal)

## [v12.6] — 2026-04-04 — A5 isolation backtest runs: or_breakout + zone_rejection@80

### Backtest jobs (config-only, no code changes)

**Job 1 — or_breakout isolation (conf≥65, full period)**
- 7,577 trades (4.2/day), WR 32.7%, PF 1.86, Gross +$292,773, **Net +$262,465**, MaxDD $2,859
- AvgWin $146.84, AvgLoss -$87.60, AvgR $38.64
- OR breakout fires on **5m only** (7,576/7,577 trades): 15m/30m almost never trigger OR breakout
- By symbol (net): MNQ +$115,051 > MGC +$65,200 > MES +$56,781 > MCL +$25,433
- By confidence (net): all buckets profitable; 90%+ bucket has WR 45.6% vs 30% at 65-70%
- **Confirmed real edge**: large avg winner ($147) vs avg loser ($88) = 1.68 R:R; low WR is expected for breakout strategy

**Job 2 — zone_rejection isolation (conf≥80, full period)**
- 24,118 trades (13.5/day), WR 48.2%, PF 0.643, Gross -$107,338, **Net -$203,810**, MaxDD $108,000
- AvgWin $16.38, AvgLoss -$24.28, AvgR -$4.45
- Still fires on **5m only** (24,117/24,118 trades)
- WR remains ~48% at conf≥80 — raising the floor did NOT fix the WR problem; the avg loser is too large vs avg winner
- All symbols uniformly negative gross — no symbol is salvageable within zone_rejection

### Combined strategy calculation (from on-file jobs, no new run)
Combined = or_breakout@65 + zone_rejection@80 + pdh_breakout@65
- or_breakout@65: net +$231,465 (6,868 trades)
- zone_rejection@80: net -$203,810 (24,118 trades)
- pdh_breakout@65: net -$14,742 (2,497 trades)
- **Combined net: +$12,912 over 7.5 years** — barely profitable; zone_rejection still destroys the or_breakout edge

### Key findings
1. **or_breakout is a viable standalone strategy**: +$262K net over 7.5 years, PF 1.86, MaxDD only $2.9K, 4.2 trades/day
2. **zone_rejection is not salvageable at current R:R structure**: at conf≥80 the WR is still 48% but avg loser exceeds avg winner ($24 vs $16) — raising confidence doesn't fix the R:R mismatch
3. **15m/30m timeframes produce almost zero or_breakout signals**: 5m is entirely responsible for OR breakout edge; 15m/30m can be disabled for this setup
4. **MNQ drives majority of or_breakout P&L** (+$115K of $262K net); MGC/MES contribute meaningfully; MCL is lowest contributor

## [v12.5] — 2026-04-04 — Backtest zone_rejection dedup fix + full A5 run

### Backtest engine: zone_rejection dedup overhaul (`server/backtest/engine.js`)
- **Root cause**: dedup key included `setup.time` (unique per bar), so the same zone could add a new key on every 5m/15m/30m bar — 1-trade-at-a-time was the only gate, leaving ~18 zone_rejection trades/day
- **Fix 1 — zone-level bucketing**: changed dedup key for `zone_rejection` from per-bar timestamp to per-zone-level bucket: `${symbol}-${tf}-zone_rejection-${direction}-${Math.round(setup.zoneLevel / atr * 4)}` (0.25 ATR resolution). Same zone can only fire once per day per TF.
- **Fix 2 — 60-min per-direction cooldown**: after any zone_rejection fires, suppress all zone_rejections for the same symbol+direction for 60 minutes, regardless of zone level. Prevents re-entering failed zone clusters.
- **Fix 3 — cross-TF shared cooldown**: `lastZoneRejTs` declared at symbol scope (outside TF loop), keyed by `date-direction`. A fire on 5m blocks 15m and 30m for the same 60-min window. Prevents the same zone being re-entered on a higher TF moments later.
- **Result**: zone_rejection count in 2022 annual slice dropped from ~6,750 to ~3,928 (42% reduction); trades/symbol/day: ~4 (vs ~7 pre-fix), consistent with genuine signal frequency under 60-min cooldown.

### A5 full-period backtest (full available range)
- 2022 validation results: 5,386 trades total, WR 44.6%, PF 1.063, Gross +$29,332, Sharpe 4.28
  - `zone_rejection`: 3,928 trades (15.6/day), WR 47.3%, gross -$22,781
  - `or_breakout`: 1,031 trades (4.1/day), WR 32.2%, gross +$53,524
  - `pdh_breakout`: 427 trades (1.7/day), WR 49.4%, gross -$1,411
- Full-period (2018-09-24 → 2026-04-01): 34,807 trades, WR 45.1%, PF 1.05, Gross +$136,591, Net -$2,637 (fees $139,228)
  - `or_breakout` sole gross-profitable setup: +$258,937 gross, 3.8/day, 32.4% WR (large avg winners)
  - `zone_rejection` gross loser: -$117,591, 14.2/day, 48.0% WR
  - `pdh_breakout`: -$4,754, 1.4/day, 51.1% WR
  - Pre-fix comparison: zone_rejection 34,122→25,442 (-25%); total 43,735→34,807 (-21%); net P&L -$96K→-$2.6K

## [v12.4] — 2026-04-04 — Full Pipeline Complete: Phase 1e/1f + ETF close fixes (Phase R)

### Phase 1b: XNYS.PILLAR ETF close extraction (`server/data/historicalPipeline.js`)
- Loop 3 (OPRA ohlcv-1d) now also validates `dataset=OPRA.PILLAR`; rejects XNYS.PILLAR zips with a clear warning directing Jeff to use `Historical_data/ETF_closes/`
- Loop 4 (new): scans `Historical_data/ETF_closes/` for XNYS.PILLAR ohlcv-1d zips; verifies both `dataset=XNYS.PILLAR` and `schema=ohlcv-1d`; derives ticker from `metadata.json query.symbols[0]` (strips suffix); extracts to `raw/ETF_closes/{ticker}/`; skip-if-exists per file

### Phase 1d: rewritten — XNYS.PILLAR local file parser (`server/data/historicalPipeline.js`)
- Reads `raw/ETF_closes/{ticker}/` (written by Phase 1b loop 4); no Databento API dependency
- Auto-detects price format: `parseFloat(close) > 100000` → fixed-point ÷ 1e9, else plain decimal
- Per-ETF expected price range sanity check with `⚠ UNEXPECTED` flag and warn count on out-of-range values
- Expected ranges updated to 2018–2026+ actuals: QQQ $50–$700, SPY $100–$750, GLD $100–$500, SLV $10–$100, USO $5–$200, IWM $70–$300
- Run result: 1740 dates per ETF, 0 errors; 2019-04-12→2019-11-18 gap is a data gap in purchased XNYS data (expected)

### Phase 1e: remove lastKnownPrice fallback (`server/data/historicalPipeline.js`)
- Removed `lastKnownPrice` map and all seeding/update logic — was propagating a wrong/stale price for dates with no ETF close (e.g. seeding from 2026 price and applying it to 2013 OPRA data)
- Now: when `etfCloses[etf][date]` is null/undefined, logs `[WARN] Phase 1e: {etf} {date}: no ETF close available — skipping` and continues to next date
- Skip-if-exists simplified: no longer reads existing output file to accumulate `underlyingPrice` back into map
- Run result: 10,427 option chain files written (1738/ETF); 9,198 dates correctly skipped (pre-2018-09-24 + 2019 gap); 0 errors

### Phase 1f: HP computation complete
- No code changes required — Phase 1f was already writing to the correct path (`options/{etf}/computed/{date}.json`); engine reads from same path
- HP snapshot path confirmed: `data/historical/options/{etf}/computed/YYYY-MM-DD.json` (NOT a top-level `computed/` dir — docs corrected)
- Run result: ~1736 HP snapshots per ETF (QQQ/SPY/GLD/IWM/SLV: 1736, USO: 1733); date range 2018-09-24 → 2026-04-01; fields: `etfClose`, `futuresClose`, `atmIV`, `totalGex`, `dexBias`, `resilienceLabel`, `scaledMaxPain`, `scaledOiWalls`, `scaledGexFlip`, `computedAt`
- Removed unused `sleep()` helper and stale `symManifest` read in verify phase

### Docs
- CONTEXT_SUPPLEMENT.md: corrected output structure — `options/{etf}/computed/` not `computed/{etf}/`; added note explaining HP path matches engine read path
- CLAUDE.md: added Phase R (v12.3) row to build phases table

## [v12.3] — 2026-04-03 — ohlcv-1d ETF Close Extraction (Phase 1b/1d local files)

### Phase 1b: ohlcv-1d zip detection and extraction (`server/data/historicalPipeline.js`)
- New helper `findETFCloseZips(etf)` — finds any non-OPRA zip in `Historical_data/OPRA/{etf}/` (e.g. `DBEQ-*` downloads placed alongside the options zips)
- New helper `findAllETFCloseZips()` — calls above for all 6 ETFs
- New helper `getZipSchema(zipPath)` — reads `metadata.json` inside a zip and returns its `query.schema` string
- Phase 1b now runs a third extraction loop after the OPRA section: identifies ohlcv-1d zips by confirming `schema === 'ohlcv-1d'` via `getZipSchema` (warns and skips any mismatched file), extracts `.csv.zst` files to `data/historical/raw/OPRA/{etf}/ohlcv-1d/` — separate from the options raw files which stay in `raw/OPRA/{etf}/`
- Skip-if-exists applies per extracted file; dry-run mode supported

### Phase 1d: rewritten to parse local extracted files (`server/data/historicalPipeline.js`)
- **Replaced Databento API call** with local file parser — no longer requires `DATABENTO_API_KEY` or `DBEQ.BASIC` subscription; reads files already extracted by Phase 1b
- New helper `tsEventToDate(tsVal)` — converts both `pretty_ts=true` ISO strings and raw nanosecond integers to `YYYY-MM-DD`
- New helper `dateFromFilename(fname)` — extracts 8-digit date from Databento filename pattern (`dbeq-basic-20130401.ohlcv-1d.csv.zst`)
- **Auto-detects price format**: if `parseFloat(close) > 100000` → fixed-point integer, divides by 1e9; otherwise treats as plain decimal. Handles both `pretty_px=true` and `pretty_px=false` downloads
- Logs progress every 200 files per ETF; logs total date count and 3 spot-check samples per ETF (first / middle / last date → close price) for visual sanity check
- Always overwrites `etf_closes.json` as a full rebuild (Phase 1d reads all extracted files each run)
- Warns and continues if a per-file decompression or CSV parse error occurs (`errLog`)

### Run sequence
```bash
node server/data/historicalPipeline.js --phase 1b   # extract ohlcv-1d zips → raw/OPRA/{etf}/ohlcv-1d/
node server/data/historicalPipeline.js --phase 1d   # parse → etf_closes.json
node server/data/historicalPipeline.js --phase 1e   # reads etf_closes.json for underlying prices
```

## [v12.2] — 2026-04-03 — OPRA Pipeline Correctness Fixes (Phase P, A2 continued)

### Phase 1d: ETF daily closes via Databento `ohlcv-1d`
- `fetchETFDailyCloses(ticker, startIso, endIso)` added to `server/data/databento.js`
  - Dataset: `DBEQ.BASIC` (configurable via `DATABENTO_EQUITY_DATASET` env var)
  - Schema: `ohlcv-1d`, `stype_in: raw_symbol`
  - Prices: fixed-point ÷ 1e9; date derived from `ts_event` nanosecond timestamp
  - Returns `{ 'YYYY-MM-DD': closePrice }` map
- `phase1d()` rewritten — fetches QQQ/SPY/GLD/SLV/USO/IWM closes from Databento in one call per ETF over full date range; writes/merges `data/historical/etf_closes.json`
  - Incremental: starts from last known date per ticker so re-runs only fetch new dates
  - Graceful no-op if `DATABENTO_API_KEY` not set

### Phase 1e: OPRA parsing correctness fixes
- **Strike price confirmed dollar-denominated**: OPRA `strike_price` field is already in dollars (`"580.000000000"` = $580). Changed to plain `parseFloat()` — no ÷1e9 scaling applied
- **`parseDefinitionText`** simplified: returns plain `Map<id → {strike,expiry,type}>` (previously returned `{ optionMap, nonOptionIds }`); captures only C/P rows; no strike scaling heuristic
- **`parseStatisticsText`** rewritten to OI-only extraction:
  - Removed `nonOptionIds` parameter, `underlyingCandidates`, `UNDERLYING_PRICE_STAT_TYPES`, `underlyingPrice` return value — all dead code
  - Root cause confirmed via `--diagnostic`: OPRA statistics files contain only per-option-contract rows; no underlying ETF spot price row exists in any `stat_type`
  - Now scans only `stat_type=9` (open interest) rows, returns `{ oiMap }` only
- **Phase 1e main loop** updated: loads `etf_closes.json` (written by Phase 1d) at start; `underlyingPrice` resolved from `etfCloses[etf][date]` with rolling last-known-price fallback; removed dead `etf_closes.json` write side-effect at end of loop
- **`phase1e_diagnostic`**: updated to new signatures; loads `underlyingPrice` from `etf_closes.json`; removed "non-option IDs" section; notes that Phase 1d must run first

### `hpCompute.js`: backward-compatible OI field
- All OI reads changed to `c.openInterest ?? c.oi` — supports both old (`oi`) and new (`openInterest`) field name
- Phase 1e output contracts use `openInterest` field; old files with `oi` continue to work

---

## [v12.1] — 2026-04-03 — Historical Pipeline v2 + instruments.js (Phase P, A2)

### A2: instruments.js — single source of truth (`server/data/instruments.js`)
- New file: all 16 CME futures symbols with `databento`, `dbRoot`, `category`, `pointValue`, `tickSize`, `tickValue`, `optionsProxy`, `rthOnly`, `sessionHours`, `pdh_rr`
- Symbols: MNQ, MES, M2K, MYM (equity index); MGC, SIL, MHG (commodity metal); MCL (energy); M6E, M6B (FX); ZT, ZF, ZN, ZB, UB (fixed income); MBT (crypto futures)
- `DATABENTO_ROOT_TO_INTERNAL` map built dynamically — handles GC→MGC, SI→SIL, HG→MHG proxies
- Exports: `INSTRUMENTS`, `ALL_SYMBOLS`, `OPRA_UNDERLYINGS`, `POINT_VALUE`, `HP_PROXY`, `ETF_TO_FUTURES`, `FUTURES_TO_ETF`, groupings by category

### A2: historicalPipeline.js rewrite (`server/data/historicalPipeline.js`)
- **All 16 CME symbols** — reads from `instruments.js` (no hardcoded lists)
- **6 OPRA underlyings** — QQQ, SPY, GLD, SLV, USO, IWM
- **`--phase 1a|1b|1c|1d|1e|1f`** CLI arg — run any single phase independently
- **Full resumability** — `existingDates` Set per symbol pre-computed to skip already-processed dates; memory-safe at 13yr × 16 symbol scale
- **`errLog()`** — appends errors to `data/historical/errors.log` rather than crashing pipeline
- **`eta()`** — ETA estimation logged every 100 dates during Phase 1c
- **Window-aligned `aggregateBars()`** — derives 5m/15m/30m using `Math.floor(ts/tfSec)*tfSec` bucketing (matches live aggregation in snapshot.js)
- **`csvSymbolToInternal()`** — handles both `.c.0` continuous and individual contract (`MNQM6`, `M2KH5`) symbol formats
- **Per-underlying OPRA dirs** — extracts to `raw/OPRA/{underlying}/`; reads from same structure in Phase 1e
- **Unified `etf_closes.json`** — single file for all 6 ETF close prices; 3× retry with 2s delay per date

### A2: engine.js refactor (`server/backtest/engine.js`)
- Removed hardcoded `POINT_VALUE = { MNQ: 2, MES: 5, MGC: 10, MCL: 100 }`
- Removed hardcoded `HP_PROXY = { MNQ: 'QQQ', MES: 'SPY', MGC: null, MCL: null }`
- Both now imported from `server/data/instruments.js` — all symbols supported automatically

### Infrastructure: streaming zip extraction
- Replaced `adm-zip` with `unzipper` (streaming) — `adm-zip` loads entire archive into memory, crashing on 3.3 GB QQQ OPRA zip (Node 2 GiB buffer limit)
- `streamZip(zipPath, onEntry)` — streams entries one-by-one via `unzipper.Open.file()`
- `readZipEntry(zipPath, entryName)` — reads a single named entry without loading full archive
- `adm-zip` removed from `package.json`; `unzipper` added

---

## [v12.0] — 2026-04-03 — Databento Live Data Feed (Phase O, B1–B4)

### B1: Databento REST adapter (`server/data/databento.js`)
- `fetchHistoricalCandles(symbol, startIso, endIso)` — HTTPS Basic Auth, NDJSON parse, normalized output
- `startLiveFeed(symbols, onCandle)` — aligned polling loop (65s, first poll 5s after next bar close)
- `getLiveFeedStatus()` — connected state, lag seconds, last bar times per symbol
- Symbol map: MNQ→`MNQ.c.0`, MES→`MES.c.0`, MGC→`GC.c.0` (GC proxy — same price/oz), MCL→`MCL.c.0`
- Wire format normalization: `rec.hd.ts_event` (nanosecond string), fixed-point prices ÷ 1e9
- Exponential backoff on poll errors: 10s base, 5min cap

### B2: snapshot.js live gate (`server/data/snapshot.js`, `server/index.js`)
- `_isLiveMode()` — reads `features.liveData` from settings.json (5s cache) for hot-toggle support
- `writeLiveCandle(symbol, candle)` — stores incoming 1m bars, deduplicates by timestamp, trims to 500 bars
- `getCandles()` — live gate: when `liveData=true` and symbol is in `LIVE_FUTURES`, returns from in-memory store
- `POST /api/features` route restored in `server/index.js` (was documented but missing from code)
- `GET /api/datastatus` — returns source, lag, last bar times; data source status pill in dashboard topbar

### B3: Real-time candle aggregation (`server/data/snapshot.js`)
- `writeLiveCandle()` now aggregates 1m → 5m / 15m / 30m on every call
- Window alignment: `Math.floor(time / tfSeconds) * tfSeconds` — no lookahead
- Completed windows returned as `[{ tf, candle }, ...]`; partial (in-progress) bars updated in-place
- `_mergeWindow(bars, tfSeconds)` helper extracted alongside existing `_aggregateCandles()`

### B4: Event-driven scan on bar close (`server/index.js`)
- `_onLiveCandle(symbol, candle)` — calls `writeLiveCandle`, broadcasts `live_candle` event for chart, fires `runScan({ targetSymbols, targetTimeframes })` on each completed higher-TF window
- `_startDatabento()` — called at startup when `features.liveData === true`
- `runScan()` refactored to accept `{ targetSymbols, targetTimeframes }` overrides — all existing callers unaffected
- Seed-mode auto-refresh kept for crypto/SIL (not on Databento feed); futures served live

### Infrastructure
- Removed stale Databento zip downloads from project root (GLBX-*/OPRA-* files)
- `Historical_data/` folder added to `.gitignore` (large zip files, not committed)
- `data/` folder added to `.gitignore` — seed files, logs, and backtest results excluded from version control
- `DATABENTO_PROJECT.md` added to repo (integration plan and progress tracker)

---

## [v11.0] — 2026-04-02 — DD Band / CME SPAN Margin Levels (Phase N)

### New: DD Band / SPAN margin-derived price levels
- `riskInterval = CME initial margin ÷ point value` (futures); `priorClose × (0.30 / √252)` (crypto)
- Point values: MNQ=2, MES=5, MGC=10, MCL=100 (USD per point)
- Crypto symbols with DD Band support: BTC, ETH, XRP, XLM
- Five levels per symbol: `priorClose`, `ddBandUpper`, `ddBandLower`, `spanUpper`, `spanLower`
- `computeDDBands()` added to `server/analysis/indicators.js` (exported); used in scan, backtest engine, `/api/ddbands`
- SPAN margins stored in `config/settings.json → spanMargin` block: MNQ=1320, MES=660, MGC=1650, MCL=1200

### New: `scoreDDBandProximity()` confidence modifier in `server/analysis/setups.js`
- Labels and scores (directional — upper/lower variants exist for outside/beyond):
  - `room_to_run` → +8 (price well inside DD band, target has room)
  - `approaching_dd` → +4 (near DD band but not at it)
  - `neutral` → 0 (ambiguous)
  - `outside_dd_upper` / `outside_dd_lower` → −7 (price already outside band)
  - `beyond_dd_upper` / `beyond_dd_lower` → −12 (price significantly extended, close to SPAN)
  - `at_span_extreme` → −20 (price at or beyond SPAN level)
  - `pdh_beyond_dd` → −12 special case for PDH breakouts where prior day's high is beyond the DD band
- `setup.ddBandLabel` and `setup.scoreBreakdown.ddBand` added to every scored setup

### New: Chart layer — DD Bands (`public/js/chart.js`, `layers.js`)
- `ChartAPI.setDDBands(dd)` — draws 5 price lines: DD upper/lower (solid orange), SPAN upper/lower (dashed orange), prior close (dotted gray)
- Layer toggle `ddBands` added to layers.js DEFAULTS and index.html layer list

### New: DD Band topbar widget (`public/index.html`, `alerts.js`, `dashboard.css`)
- `#ddband-widget` shows DD↑ / DD↓ levels and position badge (INSIDE DD / ABOVE DD / BELOW DD / AT SPAN)
- `_fetchDDBands(symbol)` called on page load, symbol change, and SPAN margin save
- `_updateDDBandWidget(dd)` updates badge color based on price position

### New: SPAN Margin settings panel (`public/index.html`, `alerts.js`)
- Collapsible panel in the Layers sidebar with 4 numeric inputs (MNQ/MES/MGC/MCL)
- Save button POSTs to `/api/settings/span` and re-fetches DD bands

### New: Pine Script DD Band lines (`server/index.js` → `/api/pine-script`)
- 5 `plot()` calls for DD/SPAN levels baked in as float constants at generation time
- Grouped under `group_dd` input with toggle

### Backtest: historically accurate DD Bands (`server/backtest/engine.js`)
- `computeDDBands(visibleBars, ...)` called per-bar — no lookahead
- `trade.ddBandLabel` and `trade.ddBandScore` added to each trade record

### Backtest2 UI additions (`public/backtest2.html`, `backtest2.js`)
- New "DD Band" sub-tab in Optimize tab — breakdown table by label (WR, PF, Net P&L)
- DD Band stat card in Summary tab (best/worst label WR) — shown only if ≥10 labelled trades

### Performance stats (`server/analysis/performanceStats.js`)
- `byDDBand` grouping added to `computePerformanceStats()` output

### AI commentary (`server/ai/commentary.js`)
- DD Band context line added to prompt when `setup.ddBandLabel` is set and `extras.ddBands` available

### Infrastructure
- New API routes: `GET /api/ddbands`, `POST /api/settings/span`
- `/api/ddbands` now includes `currentPrice` for widget position badge
- Service worker: `futuresedge-v34` → `futuresedge-v35`

---

## [v10.3.1] — 2026-04-03 — Backtest2 UX: Run Labels, Compare Fixes, Config Restore

### Run labels for backtest jobs (`public/js/backtest2.js`)
- `_jobLabels` object in localStorage (`bt2_job_labels`) stores rename overrides keyed by jobId
- `_getJobLabel(jobId, config)` resolves: override → `config.label` → auto-generated name (`symbols · MM-DD → MM-DD`)
- Optional label input (`#bt2-run-label`) shown in config panel before running — saved into `config.label`
- Inline rename button (✏) on each job row in the Previous Runs list — click to rename in-place
- Job delete also clears the label override from localStorage

### Compare tab fixes (`public/js/backtest2.js`, `backtest2.css`)
- Fixed broken equity curve fetch URL: `/api/backtest/jobs/${jobId}/results` → `/api/backtest/results/${jobId}`
- Compare selector dropdowns now display run label/name instead of raw job ID
- Fixed selector styling: `background: var(--bg-panel)`, `color: var(--text)`, `border: 1px solid var(--border)` — previously unreadable dark-on-dark

### Config panel restore when loading a previous job (`public/js/backtest2.js`)
- `_populateConfigFromJob(cfg)` restores all config fields when clicking a previous job:
  - Date range, symbols, timeframes, setup types, confidence, balance, contracts, fee, max hold
  - Trading hours checkboxes (calls `setExcludeHours(cfg.excludeHours || [])`)
  - Run label input pre-populated (so a rename is obvious)

---

## [v10.3] — 2026-04-02 — Optimize Tab in backtest2 (from trade data)

### New: Optimize tab in backtest2.html (`public/backtest2.html`, `backtest2.js`, `backtest2.css`)
- Fifth tab "Optimize" added to the backtest2 results area — works entirely from
  `_currentResults.trades` already in memory; no new API calls.
- Shows placeholder message when no job is loaded; renders on tab click.

**Confidence sub-tab**
- Setup type + symbol selects (populated dynamically from loaded trades; selection preserved).
- 4 metric cards: optimal confidence floor, WR at optimal, PF at optimal, trade count.
- Threshold table (floors 60/65/70/75/80/85/90%): N, win rate bar, PF, avg R, grade badge.
- Optimal row highlighted with accent left-border + ★; low-N rows get amber badge.
- Sample warning banner when fewer than 30 completed trades.
- MTF confluence impact section (shown when both groups have n ≥ 3).

**Regime sub-tab**
- Direction card: bullish vs bearish win rate bars.
- HP Proximity card: at_level / near_level / other (shown when HP enabled in run).
- Informational notice: regime type / trend alignment / calendar gate not captured in
  backtest trade records (v10.x limitation — gates applied upstream in signal detection).

**Time of Day sub-tab**
- Heatmap grid covering ET hours 9–18, one row per setup type + "All setups" header row.
- Colors: green ≥ 72%, amber ≥ 55%, red < 55%, gray when n < 3.
- RTH hours (9–16) marked with accent top border.
- Trade count shown in cell tooltip.
- Static info note about −10 confidence penalty for sub-50% hours.

**Notifications sub-tab** (static design reference)
- Three tier cards (Tier 1: sound; Tier 2: sound + flash; Tier 3: full alert + banner).
- 5-step deduplication logic list.
- Staleness decay visual with 4 opacity levels.

**CSS** (`backtest2.css`): Added `bt2-opt-*` class family matching existing bt2 variables.

---

## [v10.2] — 2026-04-02 — Optimize Tab (backtest.html)

### New API Route — `/api/performance/optimize` (`server/index.js`, `server/analysis/performanceStats.js`)
- Added `computeOptimizeStats(alerts)` to `performanceStats.js` — computes:
  - `bySetupAndThreshold`: WR/PF/avgR at confidence floors 60/65/70/75/80/85/90% with `optimalFloor` (highest PF where n≥10) and `sampleWarning` (n<30).
  - `byRegime`: trend+aligned / trend+misaligned / range win rates per setup type.
  - `byAlignment`: aligned vs misaligned win rates per setup type.
  - `byCalendar`: nearEvent true vs false win rates.
  - `byMtf`: MTF confluence group win rates (groups with n<5 merged into "MTF other").
  - `byHour`: UTC hour win rates (groups with n<3 excluded).
  - `rawAlerts`: minimal alert fields for client-side per-symbol recomputation.
- Added `GET /api/performance/optimize` route with 5-minute response cache.
- Falls back to archived alerts if alertCache is empty.

### Optimize Tab — `backtest.html`
- New **Optimize** tab alongside the existing **Replay** tab.
- Shared controls: Setup Type and Symbol selects (state saved to localStorage).
- Four sub-tabs:
  - **Confidence Threshold**: metric cards (optimal floor, WR, PF, sample n) + threshold table with inline bar charts, assessment badges (strong edge / marginal / noise zone / no data), MTF confluence impact table.
  - **Regime Gate**: 3 bar-list cards — Regime Type+Alignment, Trend Alignment Gate, Calendar Gate. Inline notice when alignment WR difference <5pp.
  - **Time of Day**: UTC hour heatmap for all 4 setup types (green ≥65%, amber 50–64%, red <50%, gray = no data).
  - **Notifications**: static tier cards (Tier 1/2/3), deduplication logic steps, staleness decay reference.
- Per-symbol recomputation: when Symbol ≠ All, full `_computeOptForAlerts()` runs client-side on `rawAlerts`.
- Loading spinner while fetching; sub-tab selection persisted to localStorage.

## [v10.1] — 2026-04-02 — Backtest Bias Fixes, Hour Filter & Compare

### Backtest Engine — Bias Fixes (`server/backtest/engine.js`)
- **Current-bar filter**: Added `if (setup.time !== detectTs) continue` in both backtest loops. Setups only fire when the triggering candle IS the bar that just closed. Eliminates stale entry prices — prior to this fix, `setup.entry = c.close` from a candle 10–20 bars in the past was used as entry, with price already past TP, creating phantom bar-1 wins.
- **OR breakout per-session dedup**: Changed dedup key to `${symbol}-${date}-or_breakout-${direction}` so OR breakout fires at most once per session per direction (first clean break only). Previously fired on every 1m bar above the OR level (63–88 trades/day in some sessions).
- **maxDrawdown from trade sequence**: Replaced daily equity-based drawdown calculation with trade-by-trade running peak-to-trough. Daily netting was masking intraday losses, reporting $0 drawdown on runs with hundreds of losing trades.
- **`seenSetupKeys` dedup key**: Changed from `${symbol}-${date}-${tf}-${type}-${direction}-${round(zoneLevel)}` to `${symbol}-${tf}-${setup.time}-${type}-${direction}`. Zone level was fractional and shifted slightly across bar iterations, allowing the same zone to re-fire with a stale price.

### Backtest Engine — Hour Filter (`server/backtest/engine.js`)
- Added `excludeHours` config parameter (array of ET hours 0–23 to skip).
- Trades whose entry falls in an excluded hour are skipped before outcome resolution.

### Backtest UI — Hour Filter (`public/backtest2.html`, `backtest2.js`, `backtest2.css`)
- New **Trading Hours (ET)** section inside Advanced panel.
- Three session groups: Overnight (18–8 ET), RTH (9–16), After Hours (17).
- Each hour is a checkbox tile — unchecked = skip.
- Preset buttons: **All**, **RTH Only**, **None**.
- Excluded hours saved/restored with config via localStorage.

### Backtest UI — Compare Tab (`public/backtest2.html`, `backtest2.js`, `backtest2.css`)
- New **Compare** tab supporting up to 6 runs side by side.
- Color-coded run selectors with remove buttons; populates from previous runs list.
- **Overlaid equity curves** using TradingView Lightweight Charts, x-axis = trade number (normalizes across different date ranges).
- **Full comparison table** with six sections:
  - Configuration: date range, symbols, timeframes, setup types, min confidence, max hold, fee/RT, contracts, excluded hours
  - Overall Performance: WR, PF, gross P&L, max drawdown, avg win/loss, avg R, expectancy, Sharpe, won/lost/timeout, largest win/loss
  - By Setup Type: WR + P&L per setup (dynamic, based on what's in each run)
  - By Timeframe: WR + P&L per timeframe
  - By Symbol: WR + P&L per symbol (only shown when multiple symbols)
  - By Direction: bullish vs bearish WR + P&L
  - By Confidence: WR per confidence bucket (65–70%, 70–80%, 80–90%, 90%+)
- Best value in each metric row highlighted in green.
- **Export CSV** exports the full rendered table.
- New `GET /api/backtest/jobs/:jobId/results` route used to fetch equity curves for comparison chart.

### Service Worker
- Bumped to `futuresedge-v31`.

---

## [v10.0] — 2026-04-02 — Historical Backtesting System

### Data Pipeline (`server/data/historicalPipeline.js`)
- Phase 1a: Zip inventory — discovers and logs all GLBX/OPRA zip file structure
- Phase 1b: Extracts `.csv.zst` files from zips to `data/historical/raw/`
- Phase 1c: Processes GLBX 1m futures bars → daily JSON files per symbol per TF (1m/5m/15m); front-month selection by volume; lookahead validation
- Phase 1d: Fetches QQQ/SPY daily closes from Yahoo Finance v8 API
- Phase 1e: Processes OPRA definition + statistics CSVs → per-date options OI files; filters ±25% spot, ≤45 DTE, OI > 0
- Phase 1f: Runs Black-Scholes HP computation for each date → `computed/YYYY-MM-DD.json`
- Data coverage: 64 trading days (2025-12-31 – 2026-03-31), MNQ/MES/MGC/MCL, QQQ/SPY options
- Uses `@mongodb-js/zstd` for zstd decompression and `adm-zip` for zip reading (Node 24 native zstd had multi-frame issues)
- Standalone script — runs independently of the server

### HP Computation (`server/data/hpCompute.js`)
- Pure Black-Scholes implementation in JavaScript (no external libraries)
- normalCDF via Horner method (7-decimal accuracy), Black-Scholes delta/gamma
- IV approximation: realized vol proxy from 20-day log returns × term structure factor
- Computes: GEX/DEX, max pain, call/put walls, GEX flip, OI walls, hedge pressure zones, resilience score
- Scales all levels to futures price space via historical ETF→futures ratio
- Skip-if-exists logic + `--recompute` flag

### Backtest Engine (`server/backtest/engine.js`)
- Stateless bar-by-bar replay — `runBacktestMTF()` uses pre-derived 5m/15m/30m files
- CRITICAL: `visibleBars = bars.slice(0, i+1)` — zero lookahead bias
- Outcome resolution via 1m bars: SL/TP touch detection, timeout after configurable max bars
- P&L calculation: point value × contracts − fee per RT
- Full statistics package: WR, PF, avg R, Sharpe, max drawdown, expectancy
- Breakdown by symbol, setup type, timeframe, hour, confidence bucket, HP proximity, resilience label
- `buildMarketContextFromHP()` — applies v9.0 HP scoring from historical snapshots
- Async job system: `launchBacktest()` → jobId; poll `/api/backtest/status/:id`
- Results saved to `data/backtest/results/{jobId}.json` (immutable)

### API Routes (added to `server/index.js`)
- `POST /api/backtest/run` — launch async backtest, returns jobId
- `GET /api/backtest/status/:jobId` — poll status
- `GET /api/backtest/results/:jobId` — full results JSON
- `GET /api/backtest/jobs` — list all jobs
- `DELETE /api/backtest/jobs/:jobId` — delete job + results
- `GET /api/backtest/replay/:jobId?symbol=MNQ&date=2026-01-15` — replay data for chart

### Backtest UI (`public/backtest2.html` + `backtest2.js` + `backtest2.css`)
- Config panel: date range, symbols, timeframes, setup types, min confidence, HP toggle, advanced options
- Summary tab: 9 stat cards, equity curve (TradingView Lightweight Charts), 7 breakdown bar charts
- Trades tab: sortable/filterable table, click-to-replay, CSV export
- Replay tab: animated 1m chart with playback controls (play/pause/step/skip-to-alert), speed selector (1x-500x), HP level lines, running P&L
- Config saved/restored from localStorage
- Previous runs panel with quick load

### Integration
- `buildMarketContextFromHP()` maps historical HP snapshots to v9.0 `marketContext` shape
- `applyMarketContext()` from `setups.js` runs on historical setups → full HP-adjusted confidence in backtest results
- Nav "Backtest" link added to all pages
- Service worker bumped to v26, backtest2 assets added to SHELL_ASSETS

---

## [v9.0] — 2026-04-01 — Three-Layer Confidence Scoring (HP × VIX × DXY)

### New Module: `server/analysis/marketContext.js`
- `buildMarketContext(symbol, indicators, options, getCandles, corrMatrix)` — async, builds a per-symbol context object once per scan cycle
- **HP sub-object**: nearest HP level (type, price, distance_atr), pressureDirection (support/resistance/neutral), inCorridor flag with corridorBounds, freshness decay pts, base multiplier
- **VIX sub-object**: live level, regime (low/normal/elevated/crisis), direction (rising/falling/flat), stressFlag
- **DXY sub-object**: direction, correlationWithSymbol from rolling matrix, instrument-specific alignment bonuses (long/short)
- **Options sub-object**: dexScore, dexBias, resilienceLabel, stressFlag mirror
- All sub-objects degrade gracefully to safe defaults when data is unavailable

### Setup Scoring: `server/analysis/setups.js`
- New exported function `applyMarketContext(baseScore, setup, marketContext)`
- **HP multiplier**: at level ≤0.3 ATR → 1.20 (aligned), 1.05 (neutral), 0.85 (opposing); near level 0.3–0.75 ATR → 1.10; corridor → 1.08 reversal / 0.88 breakout; no nearby → 1.00
- **Resilience multiplier**: resilient → ×1.15 reversal / ×0.90 breakout; fragile → ×0.90 reversal / ×1.15 breakout
- **VIX multiplier**: low → ×1.10 breakout; elevated → ×1.10 reversal / ×0.90 breakout; crisis → ×0.90 reversal / ×0.85 breakout; direction nudge ±0.05
- Combined multiplier clamped to 0.80–1.30
- **Additive bonuses**: DEX ±3–8 pts (direction-aware), DXY ±3–8 pts (instrument-gated), freshness decay 0/−5/−10/−15 pts (halved on 0DTE days)
- `scoreBreakdown.context` field added to every setup object with full breakdown
- Applied after all base scoring and calendar gating in `detectSetups()`

### Scan Engine: `server/index.js`
- `buildMarketContext` called once per symbol per scan cycle before the per-TF loop
- `marketContext` passed to `detectSetups` via `opts.marketContext`
- Economic calendar fetch is now always-on (removed stale `settings.features?.economicCalendar` guard)
- `features` key removed from `computeIndicators` opts (no longer in settings)

### Frontend: `public/js/alerts.js` + `dashboard.css`
- `_fmtContextBreakdown(ctx)` renders context row below base score breakdown
- Shows: base score, combined multiplier (×N.NN), VIX regime badge (color-coded), HP nearest level + distance, DEX/DXY bonuses if non-zero, freshness decay if negative, stress flag warning if high VIX + fragile structure

### Prerequisites resolved
- `server/data/snapshot.js`: `MACRO_SYMBOLS` set added (DXY, VIX, QQQ, SPY, GLD, USO, SLV); exported alongside CRYPTO_SYMBOLS
- `server/analysis/indicators.js`: VP/OR/sessionLevels skip macro symbols (`!isMacro` guard)
- `server/data/options.js`: `lastFetchedAt: Date.now()` added to result before caching; available in all return paths via object spread

---

## [v8.0] — 2026-03-31 — QQQ Options Intelligence + Pine Script Export

### Added — CBOE Options Data Source
- `server/data/options.js` — complete rewrite from Yahoo Finance v7 (broken, requires crumb auth) to CBOE Delayed Quotes API (`cdn.cboe.com/api/global/delayed_quotes/options/QQQ.json`). Free, no auth, returns full chain with delta/gamma/iv/OI per contract.
- Option ticker parser: CBOE format `QQQ260330C00500000` → expiry/type/strike.
- Strike filter: ±25% of spot (excludes deep ITM/OTM which distort GEX and max pain).
- Expiry filter: next 30 days only (nearest-term OI most actionable).

### Added — DEX (Dealer Delta Exposure)
- Computed from CBOE delta × OI across all strikes. Dealers are short options they sold; to stay delta-neutral they hold offsetting futures positions.
- Normalized to −100/+100 score. Bias labels: `bullish` (>20), `bearish` (<−20), `neutral`.
- Displayed in options widget topbar: `DEX: +72 bullish`.

### Added — Resilience Score
- 0–100 composite: GEX sign component (±50), flip proximity adjustment (±30), DEX alignment bonus (±15).
- Labels: `resilient` (≥65), `neutral` (40–64), `fragile` (<40).
- Displayed in options widget topbar: `Resilience: 68 resilient`.

### Added — Liquidity Zones
- Clusters of adjacent strikes where combined OI ≥ 70th percentile. Adjacent strikes grouped into zones.
- Each zone: `{ low, high, center, totalOI, bias }`. Bias: `call` (overhead resistance), `put` (below support), `balanced` (contested pivot).
- Top 5 zones returned; scaled to futures price space.
- Drawn on chart as filled horizontal bands (blue/teal/yellow by bias).

### Added — Hedge Pressure Zones
- Top 5 strikes by |GEX|. Positive GEX = dealer buying support (green). Negative = dealer selling resistance (red).
- Top 3 shown on chart as dashed lines with ▲/▼ labels.

### Added — Pivot Candidates
- Strikes where |callOI − putOI| / totalOI < 25% AND totalOI ≥ median. No dominant dealer direction → natural turning points.
- Top 3 shown on chart as orange dotted lines.

### Added — Accurate ETF→Futures Scaling
- `_fetchDailyLevels()` fetches `MNQ=F` and `QQQ` live prices simultaneously from Yahoo Finance.
- Ratio = `liveFuturesPrice / liveEtfPrice` captured at same moment — eliminates prior ~10% error from mixing stale seed candles with CBOE delayed prices.

### Added — QQQ Daily Reference Levels
- `prevDayOpen`, `prevDayClose`, `curDayOpen` fetched from Yahoo daily endpoint.
- Intraday 5m fallback for `curDayOpen` when daily in-progress candle open is null.
- All three scaled to futures price space and drawn on chart (purple/amber/silver dotted lines).

### Added — Pine Script Export
- `GET /api/pine-script?symbol=MNQ` — generates complete TradingView Pine Script v6 with all levels baked in as constants.
- All levels rendered as `plot()` series — integrated with chart price scale and data window (not overlay drawings).
- `line.new(extend=extend.right)` + `label.new()` at `barstate.islast` adds right-extending lines and labels past the current bar.
- `fill()` between `plot()` pairs creates filled liquidity zone bands.
- Info table (P/C ratio, ATM IV, DEX, Resilience, Max Pain, GEX Flip, timestamp) via `table.new()`.
- Button in nav: `Pine Script` → copies to clipboard. Repaste daily (or mid-session on 0DTE days Mon/Wed/Fri).
- Pine Script v6 syntax: `array.new<float>`, explicit type annotations, individual `array.set()` calls, no trailing dots on floats.

### Fixed — seedFetch.js Micro Tickers
- Changed all SYMBOLS from `NQ=F`/`ES=F`/`GC=F`/`CL=F` to `MNQ=F`/`MES=F`/`MGC=F`/`MCL=F`.
- Full-size and micro contracts trade at slightly different prices; using full-size for micro candles produced ~0.1–0.3% price discrepancy, compounding into incorrect options scaling ratios.

### Fixed — GEX Flip Accuracy
- Added ±25% spot strike filter to exclude deep ITM/OTM options from GEX scan.
- Changed to outward-from-spot scan (alternating above/below) instead of sequential scan — gives nearest actionable flip level rather than a deep OTM artifact.

### Added — Docs (docs.html)
- Full "QQQ Options Levels" section with table of all 8 chart lines, explanations of each metric, widget decoder, and usage guidance.

## [v7.0] — 2026-03-04 — All-Setups Scanner + MTF Confluence

### Added — All-Setups Scanner (`/scanner.html`)
- `public/scanner.html` — new page: live table of every active setup across all symbols × timeframes.
- `public/js/scanner.js` — fetches `/api/alerts?limit=100`; connects via WebSocket for instant push on `setup` / `data_refresh` / `outcome_update` events; new-row flash animation.
- `public/css/scanner.css` — scanner-specific styles: confidence bar, MTF pills, near-event badge, sortable headers, WS status dot.
- Columns: Symbol, TF, Setup Type, Direction, Confidence (bar + %), Entry / TP / SL, Regime, MTF confluence pills, Age, View↗ button.
- Filters: Min Confidence, Direction (All/Long/Short), Setup type, Symbol, Status (Open/All), MTF-only toggle.
- Summary bar: total count, MTF count, long/short split, last-update time.
- "View ↗" button writes `bt_jump` to sessionStorage and navigates to the dashboard chart (reuses the existing backtest jump mechanism).
- Scanner nav link added to all pages (index.html, commentary.html, performance.html, backtest.html).

### Added — Multi-Timeframe Confluence
- `server/index.js` `runScan()` — per-symbol, after collecting all setup candidates across all timeframes, annotates each setup where the **same direction** fires on ≥2 timeframes:
  - `setup.mtfConfluence = { tfs: ['5m','15m'], bonus: N }` added to the setup object.
  - Confidence boosted by **+10 per confirming TF** (max +20, capped at 100).
  - Rationale string appended: `· MTF 5m/15m`.
- MTF confluence is visible in the Scanner (TF pills) and in the Alert feed rationale on the dashboard.

### Changed
- `public/sw.js` — cache bumped to `futuresedge-v3`; `scanner.html`, `scanner.js`, `scanner.css` added to SHELL_ASSETS.

---

## [v6.0] — 2026-03-04 — Multi-Timeframe + Crypto Futures

### Added — 1h / 2h / 4h Timeframes (all instruments)
- `server/data/seedFetch.js` — fetches Yahoo Finance `60m` interval for all futures symbols; derives `2h` (2× 1h) and `4h` (4× 1h) and writes seed files.
- `server/data/snapshot.js` — `VALID_TIMEFRAMES` extended to include `'1h'`, `'2h'`, `'4h'`; on-the-fly derivation fallback if seed files are missing.
- `server/index.js` — `SCAN_TIMEFRAMES` updated to `['5m','15m','30m','1h','2h','4h']`.
- `public/index.html` — 1h / 2h / 4h timeframe buttons added.

### Added — BTC, ETH, XRP Crypto Perpetual Futures (Coinbase INTX)
- `server/data/coinbaseFetch.js` — new module; fetches OHLCV from `https://api.international.coinbase.com/api/v1/instruments/{BTC-PERP|ETH-PERP|XRP-PERP}/candles`; response field: `aggregations`; paginates in MAX_BARS=300 windows; derives `4h` from `1h`; graceful warn-and-continue on failures.
- `server/data/seedFetch.js` — calls `fetchAllCrypto()` at the end of every seed refresh.
- `server/data/snapshot.js` — `VALID_SYMBOLS` includes `'BTC'`, `'ETH'`, `'XRP'`; `CRYPTO_SYMBOLS` exported.
- `server/analysis/indicators.js` — `CRYPTO_SYMBOLS` guard: `volumeProfile`, `openingRange`, `sessionLevels` return `null` for crypto (24/7, no RTH session).
- `server/analysis/setups.js` — `CRYPTO_SYMBOLS` guard: PDH RTH filter removed for crypto; OR breakout skipped for crypto; `PDH_RR` entries added for BTC/ETH/XRP (2.0:1).

---

## [v5.0] — 2026-03-04 — Market Depth Upgrade

### Added — HVN/LVN (High and Low Volume Nodes)
- `server/analysis/volumeProfile.js` — new `_extractNodes()` helper: identifies up to 5 High Volume Nodes (buckets ≥ 1.5× mean volume, excluding POC) and up to 3 Low Volume Nodes (buckets ≤ 0.4× mean, within value area).
- `computeVolumeProfile()` return now includes `hvn: []` and `lvn: []` price arrays alongside existing `poc/vah/val`.
- `public/js/chart.js` — `_drawVolumeProfile()` extended: HVN lines drawn amber dotted, LVN lines lavender dotted; both toggled with the existing Volume Profile layer.

### Added — CVD (Cumulative Volume Delta) Sub-Chart
- `public/js/chart.js` — `_computeCVD(candles)`: estimates per-bar delta from OHLCV (`volume × (2×(close−low)/(high−low) − 1)`), resets at RTH open (13:30 UTC); accumulates into session CVD.
- Second TradingView Lightweight Charts instance in `#cvd-container`: green/red histogram (per-bar delta) + blue cumulative line. Time scale synced one-way from main chart scroll/zoom.
- `public/index.html` — `#cvd-container` div added inside `#chart-wrap`; CVD layer checkbox added.
- `public/css/dashboard.css` — `#chart-wrap` changed from `position:relative` to `display:flex; flex-direction:column`; `#chart-container` changed to `flex:1`; `#cvd-container` 120px height (90px mobile), hidden until layer is toggled on.
- Layer key: `cvd` — defaults on; toggling collapses/expands the sub-panel.

### Added — Options Levels (OI Walls, Max Pain, P/C Ratio, ATM IV)
- `server/data/options.js` — fetches Yahoo Finance nearest-expiry options chain for each futures ticker (NQ=F, ES=F, GC=F, CL=F). Computes: top-3 OI walls, max pain strike (standard intrinsic-value minimization), put/call ratio by OI, ATM implied volatility. 1-hour in-memory cache; returns `null` gracefully when data unavailable.
- `GET /api/options?symbol=` — returns `{ symbol, options: {...} | null }`.
- `public/js/chart.js` — `_drawOptionsLevels()`: OI walls rendered as deep-orange dashed lines (`OI1/2/3`, dimming by rank); max pain as magenta dotted line (`MaxPain`). New `ChartAPI.setOptionsLevels(data)` method.
- `public/js/alerts.js` — `_fetchOptionsData()` called on page load and on every `chartViewChange`; `_updateOptionsWidget()` updates topbar P/C ratio and IV% display.
- `public/index.html` — Options Levels layer checkbox; `#options-widget` topbar element (P/C + IV).
- `public/css/dashboard.css` — `.options-widget` and supporting classes.
- Layer key: `optionsLevels` — defaults on; gracefully hides when Yahoo has no options data.

---

## [v4.0] — 2026-03-04 — Trading Intelligence Upgrade

### Added — Historical Setup Archive
- `server/storage/log.js` — `appendToArchive()`, `updateArchiveOutcome()`, `loadArchive()` functions.
- `data/logs/setup_archive.json` — append-only archive; every setup snapshot is written on first detection, never evicted.
- `server/index.js` — `_cacheAlert()` now calls `appendToArchive()`; re-evaluations sync resolved outcomes back to archive via `updateArchiveOutcome()`.
- `GET /api/archive?symbol=&start=&end=&limit=` — query historical setups (newest-first, max 2000).
- `server/index.js` — `userOverride: true` alerts are excluded from open-outcome re-evaluation loop.

### Added — Manual Outcome Marking (Won/Lost buttons)
- `PATCH /api/alerts/:key` — set `outcome: 'won'|'lost'|'open'` on any alert; sets `userOverride: true` so server won't re-evaluate it.
- `public/js/alerts.js` — taken cards with `outcome: 'open'` now show ✓ Won / ✗ Lost buttons; clicking calls the new PATCH endpoint and refreshes the card.
- `public/css/dashboard.css` — `outcome-won` cards now have green background tint; `outcome-lost` cards have red tint. New `.outcome-header-badge` shows ✓ WON or ✗ LOST prominently in the card header.

### Added — Manual Trade Logging
- `POST /api/trades` — `alertKey` is now optional; manual trades get a synthetic key `MANUAL:symbol:timestamp`.
- `public/index.html` — `＋ Trade` button added to Alert Feed panel header; `#manual-trade-form` placeholder div added.
- `public/js/alerts.js` — `_openManualForm()` / `_renderManualTrades()`: manual form with symbol, direction, entry/SL/TP/exit/setup type/notes; renders in a separate "Manual Trades" section in the feed.
- `public/css/dashboard.css` — styles for manual trade form, `MANUAL` badge, `.mf-*` form elements.

### Added — OB/FVG Quality Scoring
- `server/analysis/iof.js` — `detectFVGs()` now accepts `atrCurrent`; both FVGs and OBs get `atrRatio` and `strength: 'strong'|'normal'|'weak'` fields.
  - FVG strong threshold: `atrRatio ≥ 0.8`; weak: `< 0.35`.
  - OB strong threshold: `atrRatio ≥ 1.2`; weak: `< 0.5`.
- `server/analysis/indicators.js` — passes `atrCurrent` to `detectFVGs()`.
- `server/index.js` — API filters updated: weak FVGs excluded; weak tested OBs excluded (mitigated already excluded).

### Updated — Chart Zone Rendering
- `public/js/chart.js` — OBs and FVGs now render with strength-based visual differentiation:
  - Strong OBs: solid, 80% opacity, 2px wide, `OB↑★` label.
  - Tested OBs: dashed, 40% opacity, 1px, `OB↑~` label (tilde = touched).
  - Strong FVGs: 75% opacity, 2px; normal FVGs: 45% opacity, 1px; `FVG↑★` vs `FVG↑`.

### Updated — Enhanced AI Commentary
- `server/ai/commentary.js` — `_buildPrompt()` now accepts optional `extrasMap` per `symbol:tf`:
  - Adds **Zone Context** block per setup: nearby open FVGs, untested/tested OBs (within 2×ATR), Volume Profile POC/VAH/VAL, Asian/London session H/L, historical WR/PF for this symbol.
  - Updated commentary instructions: Claude now specifically asked to reference FVG/OB prices, identify zone-based invalidation, and compare to historical performance.
  - `max_tokens` increased: single 400 → 700; batch 1200 → 2000.
- `server/index.js` — `_refreshCommentary()` builds `extrasMap` from fresh indicators for each alert's `symbol:tf`; single commentary route also builds and passes context.

---

## [v3.3] — 2026-03-04 — Filter Input Width Fix

### Updated — `public/css/dashboard.css`
- `.filter-input` width: 46px → 58px — Min Conf and Max Risk inputs no longer clip numbers with browser spin controls.
- `.filter-input.narrow` width: 32px → 44px — R:R Ratio and contract count inputs now display "2.0" and "5" without truncation.

---

## [v3.2] — 2026-03-04 — Dashboard Layout Redesign

### Updated — `public/index.html`
- **Alert Feed moved to dedicated left panel** (`<aside id="left-panel">`, 280px) — alert feed, WR bar, AutoTrader panel, and filter controls now live on the left side of the chart instead of the right.
- **Correlation Heatmap moved to top of right panel** — now always visible above the layer toggles instead of buried at the bottom below a scrollable list.
- Right panel (`#right-panel`) narrowed to 220px and now contains only Correlation Heatmap + Layers/Features.

### Updated — `public/css/dashboard.css`
- Added `#left-panel` styles (280px, `border-right`).
- `#left-panel #alert-section` given `flex: 1` so alert feed fills the panel.
- `#layers-section` given `flex: 1` + `overflow-y: auto` so layers scroll within the right panel.
- Mobile tab visibility updated: Alerts tab shows `#left-panel`; Layers tab shows `#right-panel`.

---

## [v3.1] — 2026-03-04 — Guide Fully Updated for v3.0

## [v3.0] — 2026-03-04 — Full Feature Expansion (Three Tiers)

### Added — Server Analysis Modules
- `server/analysis/volumeProfile.js` — Session volume profile: POC, VAH, VAL (70% value area). Buckets = 5× tick size per instrument. Returns current + prior session values.
- `server/analysis/openingRange.js` — RTH Opening Range (09:30–10:00 ET = 13:30–14:00 UTC). Returns Hi/Lo/Mid + `formed` flag.
- `server/analysis/sessionLevels.js` — Asian session H/L (00:00–07:00 UTC) and London session H/L (07:00–13:30 UTC).
- `server/analysis/relativeStrength.js` — MNQ vs MES session-normalized ratio and rolling 20-period Pearson correlation. Signal: `mnq_leading` / `mes_leading` / `neutral`.
- `server/analysis/correlation.js` — 4×4 rolling pairwise correlation matrix for all instruments using log returns.
- `server/analysis/performanceStats.js` — Win rate, profit factor, avg R grouped by symbol, setup type, timeframe, UTC hour, direction.

### Added — New Setup Type
- `or_breakout` in `server/analysis/setups.js` — Opening Range breakout: fires only after OR window closes (10:00 ET), RTH-gated (10:00–16:30 ET), first-close-only. Base confidence 35, +break magnitude (max 20), +regime 15, +align 10, +IOF. SL = opposite OR bound, TP = risk × 2.

### Added — Calendar Gating
- `server/analysis/setups.js` — High-impact event within 15 minutes of a setup trigger for that symbol: confidence reduced by 20 pts (floor 0), `nearEvent: true` flag added.

### Added — New API Routes
- `POST /api/features` — Hot-toggle any feature flag; persists to `config/settings.json`, no restart needed.
- `GET /api/calendar?symbol=` — Upcoming high-impact economic events, optionally filtered by symbol.

### Added — Feature Flag Architecture
- `config/settings.json` — New `features` block (10 flags). All default `true` except `soundAlerts` and `pushNotifications` (default `false`).
- Scan engine passes `features` to `computeIndicators()` and fetches calendar events before each scan (cached 1h).
- Pattern: `if (settings.features?.featureName) { compute... }` — each feature is independently gated.

### Added — New Instruments
- **MES** (Micro E-mini S&P 500, ticker `ES=F`) and **MCL** (Micro Crude Oil, ticker `CL=F`) added to all scan symbols, seed fetch, autotrader, risk settings.

### Added — New Pages
- `/performance.html` + `public/js/performance.js` + `public/css/performance.css` — Performance analytics: summary stat cards, CSS bar charts by symbol/setup/TF/direction, time-of-day heat map (RTH hours), sortable alert table.
- `/backtest.html` + `public/js/backtest.js` + `public/css/backtest.css` — Alert replay: date range + symbol + setup type + confidence filters, step-through navigation, cumulative P&L equity curve (CSS-only), "View on Chart" button.

### Updated — `public/sw.js`
- Cache version bumped to `futuresedge-v2`.
- Added `performance.html`, `backtest.html`, their CSS and JS files to `SHELL_ASSETS`.
